# My React studies

This is where I'll be uploading my studies from the <a href="https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?si=7oPlBrfVy_IwhOLv" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp React course</a>. 

Currently, I've got implemented:
- React facts card
- Business Card
- Airbnb card
- Travel Journey page

# The folder structure

The structure of the projects follows this pattern:

react-studies/      
├── public/      
├── src/         
│   ├── assets/       
│   └── components/   
└── index.html    

- The most important folder at this project is the `components` folder. This folder contais the implementation of the components of the course. Each main component have it's children components inside it's own folder.
- `index.html` contains the root div for rendering the components
